# KCL work school experience 2024
Repository for the Bioinformatics session for the KCL Work School Experience July 2024



**Description**

Bioinformatics analyses require skills that include extensive database management, query and analysing these data. Learning to code is a key skill in this field; there are different coding languages and here we will explore `R`. 
Just remember that once you learn one coding language, the skills are transferable, also learning to code is similar to learn a new language, there is a learning curve so be gentle. In this short session we will see the basis of coding in R, so that you can hopefully, continue the learning process after this experience. 

Why R? 

`R` is a freely distributed and widely used programing language and environment for statistical computing, data analysis and graphics. It is open source , widely-used and powerful programming language.
`RStudio` is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace managemen.

**Details**

Jiadai Mi, Amy Roberts, Flavia Flaviani, and Fewa Laleye are participanting in a work experience with the School of Life Course and Population Sciences. 
The workshop will be based on data analysis/bioinformatics for year 11-12 students visiting King's College London for work experience.

[Jia Dai Mi](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/jiadai-mi): 

*Hello! üëã I'm a PhD student dedicated to improving health outcomes for mothers and babies across Africa. My research focuses on understanding why some babies are delivered early (preterm birth) and exploring potential prevention methods. Using bioinformatics skills üë©üèª‚Äçüíª, I work on analysing large sets of data to identify genetic and environmental factors contributing to preterm births, as well as biomarkers that could help us predict and mitigate the risk. When I'm not working on my research, I enjoy playing board games and exploring the UK countryside with my dog üêï.*
